            description = "<p>Interested in becoming a motion design intern at Google?</p>\n\n<p>My team is hiring (at the very last minute) one talented motion design intern for the Summer 2015 season. If that\U2019s you, we would would work directly together across many teams within Google Apps, including Inbox, Calendar, Gmail, Drive and more, to help bring animations based on the new Material Design language to future app releases. It would be located in Mountain View, CA at Google\U2019s main campus, otherwise known as the Googleplex.</p>\n\n<p>Intrigued? Here\U2019s what you need to know:</p>\n\n<p>You must currently be enrolled in a full-time degree both before and after the internship (either pursuing a BS or MS). The degree should be in some arts-related field. You must have a strong understanding of Adobe After Effects (working with 2D animation is a huge plus, and even more so with UI motion design).</p>\n\n<p>Candidates from around the world will be considered, so if you don\U2019t attend school in the Bay Area, don\U2019t worry! Google has an extremely strong relocation program in place for the entirety of the 12-14 week internship, which begins in June. The interviewing process has already begun and we\U2019re hoping to wrap this up within a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, let\U2019s see what you\U2019ve got! If you meet the qualifications above, send a link to your portfolio and a quick word about yourself to motionintern@google.com \U2013 I\U2019ll be reviewing every submission, and we\U2019ll be in touch if you\U2019re a good fit. Since this is so late in the hiring process, there is no official job posting. I\U2019m relying on the talent of fellow Dribbblers to spread the word and fill this spot!</p>\n\n<p>And to keep the creative mind flowing, feel free to post a rebound showing off your Material Design-inspired animation skills! It\U2019s not required to apply and is in no way apart of the interview process, but it would certainly be fun see just how you could apply your skills here at Google!</p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>What\U2019s it like being an intern at Google? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9No-FiEInLA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Watch this</a>.\n<br />(No, it\U2019s not a link to the movie, The Internship)</p>\n\n<p>Also, check out this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Material Design Reel</a>.</p>";

So it was a pleasure to help them build something new along their way to the top. Since we started to supply design to them, they go some high seed rounds and get nice investments approx. $1,5M which was kinda satisfying to hear, that your designs were actually matter, when we were cooking from water most of the time :) </p>\n\n<p>You can see it featured on http://land-book.com/ right now, that's how it came back to me :)</p>\n\n<p>Go and visit live version https://www.snapcard.io/ (they also made some changes, as always :'( )</p>\n\n<p>I've attached the full design version I did, so you can look also here :) </p>\n\n<p>Charlie</p>\n\n<p>www.charlieisslander.com</p>";
